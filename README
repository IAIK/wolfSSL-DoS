DoS attack on wolfSSL DTLS server
=================================

This is a simple example sending ClientHello messages with spoofed sender
addresses but valid cookies to a wolfSSL based DTLS server.

 * attack.c: Sends the spoofed ClientHello messages.
 * dtls-server.c: Very simple DTLS server (slightly modified version of [1])
 * target.c: Listens and prints the number of bytes received.

Assume the following scenario:

  * dtls-server runs on a machine with IP 192.168.0.1.
  * target runs on a machine with IP 192.168.0.2.
  * attack runs on any other machine.

Now run

  $ attack -i $interface --server 192.168.0.1 --target 192.168.0.2

where $interface is the network interface the packets should be sent on. If
there is a gateway involved or attack can not detect the MAC address of the
server, specify --server-hwaddr.

attack needs superuser privileges to run.

With the included example keys and certificates, target should print

Received 48 bytes. (for the HelloVerifyRequest message)

and 7 times

Received 95 bytes. (for the ServerHello message)
Received 3281 bytes. (for the Certificate message)
Received 482 bytes. (for the ServerKeyExchange message)
Received 25 bytes. (for the ServerHelloDone message)
